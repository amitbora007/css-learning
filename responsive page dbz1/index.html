					<h4>Vegeta (ベジータ Bejīta), more specifically Vegeta IV (ベジータ四世 Bejīta Yonsei)[5], 
					recognized as Prince Vegeta (ベジータ王子 Bejīta Ōji) is the prince of the fallen Saiyan 
					race and one of the main characters of the Dragon Ball series.<br>
					
					Regal, egotistical, and full of pride, Vegeta was once a ruthless, cold-blooded warrior 
					and outright killer but later abandons his role in the Frieza Force, instead opting 
					to remain and live on Earth. His character evolves from villain, to anti-hero, then to 
					hero through the course of the series, repeatedly fighting alongside the universe's most 
					powerful warriors in order to protect his new home and surpass Goku in power.<br>
					
					Vegeta is a slim yet very well-built man of a below-average stature, standing at 164 centimeters 
					tall. His hair is black (or dark brown, depending on the media) and spikes upwards. Vegeta has a 
					prominent widow's peak. Like most Saiyans, he possesses defined eyes with a consistently stern look 
					to them. Like other Universe 7 Saiyans, he was born with a prehensile brown-furred tail, until it was 
					permanently cut off by Yajirobe.<br>

					Over the course of the series, Vegeta's physical appearance changes. While originally appearing very 
					short and lean, especially compared to his massive partner, Nappa, he later seems to be somewhat taller 
					and noticeably more muscular. His hair and forehead appears to be shorter and his facial features, which 
					are perpetually in a scowl, also look more distinct and sharply defined as the series progresses, making 
					him look much older in later sagas compared to what he looked like in his debut.
